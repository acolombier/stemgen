# Contributing to Stemgen

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

**We use [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html),
so all code changes happen through pull requests**

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We
actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/acolombier/stemgen/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/acolombier/stemgen/issues/new/choose);
it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug
report. Here's
[another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
    [This Stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)
    includes sample code that *anyone* with a basic setup can run to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you
  tried that didn't work)

Remember, we all *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Linting and code style consistency are assured by pre-commit. Make sure to
install the hooks, by running `pre-commit install`. You can also run
`pre-commit` at anytime to format your code as it is expected in this project.
